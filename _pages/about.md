I work on foundational AI problems — computational, statistical, and algorithmic — with biomedical and societal relevance. I am particularly interested in research topics pertaining to precision oncology and drug discovery.

My research also involves interdisciplinary questions pertaining to how we can ensure that the AI revolution benefits humanity.

I received my Master's degree from [Harvard University](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/), and my Bachelor of Science from the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en), where my research centered about chemical biology for epigenomics & epitranscriptomics, as well as machine learning. 

My prior studies and current work involve extensive context from the mathematical, natural, and data-driven sciences.
