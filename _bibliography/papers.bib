  abstract={We introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents.},

  abstract={We report LABS, which enables linear amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA fragments in a genome-wide, unbiased fashion, detecting cancer abnormalities with sub-nanogram inputs. Applying LABS to 100 patient samples revealed cancer-specific patterns, copy number alterations, and enhanced cancer detection accuracy.},
